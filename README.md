ðŸš§ Experimental ðŸ”¥

This is yet another HPKE implementation for JOSE and COSE.

The purpose of this experimental implementation is to address open questions regarding the IETF drafts.

- [x] Integrated Encryption - how is it signaled in JOSE and COSE, what values are used for "alg" and "enc".
- [ ] Party U / Party V - identity information in key establishment.
- [ ] Cross Mode Attacks - How are they mitigated in COSE and JOSE?
